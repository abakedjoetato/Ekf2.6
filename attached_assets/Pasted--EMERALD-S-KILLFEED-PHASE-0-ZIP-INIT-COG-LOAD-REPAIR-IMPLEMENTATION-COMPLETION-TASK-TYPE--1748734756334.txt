 EMERALD‚ÄôS KILLFEED ‚Äî PHASE 0: ZIP INIT + COG LOAD REPAIR + IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION

üß© TASK TYPE: SINGLE TASK ‚Äî ATOMIC EXECUTION

You are to complete a single atomic task with no intermediate logs, reports, commits, or checkpoints until every condition is met. This includes booting the bot without errors, fixing all failed cog loads, and completing any missing implementations required to achieve full cog functionality.

‚úÖ [PHASE 0] ‚Äî ZIP UNPACK, BOT STARTUP, & COG SYSTEM VALIDATION

‚òëÔ∏è Instructions

1. Extract the uploaded .zip project file from attached_assets

Unzip directly into the project root directory

Remove any subdirectory nesting (e.g., project/, src/, bot/)

Relocate all files from the extracted folder to /home/runner/

Delete any redundant or empty folders after relocation



2. Validate required secrets

Confirm Replit secrets or .env has the following:

BOT_TOKEN

MONGO_URI

RAILWAY_PROD=true (or equivalent production-mode flag)




3. Start the bot using the Replit "Run" button

Allow full load sequence

Validate terminal output for:

‚úÖ Discord connection confirmation

‚úÖ Slash command sync success

‚úÖ All cogs report successful loading




4. Fix any Cog Errors

If any cog fails to load:

Identify cause (e.g., ImportError, SyntaxError, missing handler)

Correct all broken imports, unresolved references, and outdated handlers

Ensure that only Pycord 2.6.1 syntax is used (no legacy discord.py)

Patch incorrect @commands.command() or @bot.command() usage with @discord.slash_command()




5. Complete All Partial or Missing Implementations

Locate stubs, pass blocks, or placeholder commands

Complete missing methods or handler logic that would prevent command execution

Restore or refactor any incomplete commands so that all slash commands return expected results



6. Confirm Full Bot Startup

All 11+ cogs must load cleanly

No stack traces or critical warnings

MongoDB must connect successfully

Slash commands must sync globally or via fallback guild sync if rate-limited

Bot must appear online and responsive in at least one connected Discord guild

üìå COMPLETION CRITERIA

[ ] All cogs report ‚Äúloaded‚Äù in startup logs

[ ] No unhandled exceptions on boot

[ ] MongoDB client is active and reachable

[ ] Bot syncs all commands successfully

[ ] All implemented commands return their expected response

[ ] No legacy syntax or deprecated decorators detected

[ ] All known command handlers are implemented and usable

[ ] EmbedFactory is properly referenced in all embed-based outputs



---

üîí EXECUTION RULES

This is a single-task batch operation

Do not checkpoint, do not log, and do not commit until all requirements are complete

If the bot crashes, fails to sync, or cogs are missing ‚Äî the task is not complete

Do not guess ‚Äî all errors must be addressed with deterministic fixes

Treat code structure as unknown ‚Äî do not assume file paths or directories without checking

Output only when all systems (cogs, DB, slash commands) are fully operational
